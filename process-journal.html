My process journal will also be able to provide an insightful walk-through of how we worked as a team, and how we got to our final destination with our 3 strongest solutions - which were then narrowed down to our one final solution. All of these iterations and explorations were essentially encapsulated through low to medium prototyping fidelities. The final concept was then taken to a high fidelity mockup, with the guidance from previous feedbacks through our design process and earlier wireframes/prototypes.  </p>

                  <p>The overarching focus of our design project was on designing and prototyping screen-based interfaces that enable interactions with autonomous vehicles in future cities, within the next 10 years. So our first task was to identify a problem scenario or a type of autonomous vehicle that we’d want to use. As a team, our first action was to look into current autonomous vehicles and the potentials of a ‘smart city’ that would use autonomous systems. This helped us to generally understand how others have implemented autonomy to assist people, and to help us gain some ideas of the problem area we wanted to work with. For me personally, this activity helped me to better understand what AI technologies can do, and what autonomous vehicles are. Frankly, I actually had no idea what autonomous technologies were before starting this project! So seeing current examples, like an autonomous friend robot, helped me to vision it physically and understand the features of autonomous devices better.

                  <p>From looking into current technology examples, and discussing about some everyday problems that we each have faced or have seen happened, my group began to collectively categorise our insights into 2 potential problem areas: Women/personal safety, and children’s education. However, this stream of thought, through further elaboration, was short-lived and was then diverted to the paramedic/medical industry. This decision was mainly through having found an overall area that all team members quickly became passionate about. I personally like that we diverted into this area of thinking, as I felt that it made us more united as a group, increased our motivation and also helped to portray a clearer potential shared vision of where we’d like our design to head towards. This clarity and collectivism hence drove us to conduct further primary and secondary research into our context over the next few days. This solidified our team’s potential directed design area of attempting to improve the efficiency of a paramedic’s process in reaching the patient and getting them back in time to the hospital. Personally, I was actually very excited to dive into this industry as it would relate to the health industry - which is an area that I’m thinking of taking my design education towards!

                  <p>At this stage, my team and I now had a clearer, but still a very broad, idea of the group’s design direction from our opportunity seeking stage. This led to our chosen context area of improving the streamline service of paramedics. This not only revealed to me how exactly my team could implement autonomous vehicles/systems to help the efficiency of paramedics, but it also assisted me to further understand the potential use of them in future cities. Now that we had a potential pathway to head towards, we decided to have a quick brainstorm session to warm us up into working as a team. It was quite fun coming up with absurd ways to help the paramedic industry, and we did have a lot of fun together here. At this stage, we were very excited to dive into our studio project together! </p>

                    <p>The next stage was explored through Task 1 of our assessment: an individual research report. This would provide the bulk of our background research to enhance our design solutions for our context. The background research allowed me to understand the context on a deeper level, and to identify real problem spaces in the paramedic industry. This helped to remove me from drawing on my prior assumptions, and to further enhance the usefulness of our design direction in the real world. This stage also surprisingly allowed me to learn something about myself. I realised that although researching was a bit dull, I wasn’t too bad at drawing out insights and key concepts from user researching. Therefore, it allowed me to further push on and help my teammates where needed. The background research is further explained below.  </p>

                    <p>Having now identified a problem scenario, my team decided to sit down together to map out the potential users for our developing designs. The reason why we decided to map this out together was that we wanted to start off with making sure that everyone on the team was on the same page. I’m super glad we did this, as it helped me to think outside the box on not only where to start with my individual report, but also on what my objective is from the user research, and what areas/who my developing concept ideas could be directed towards. Additionally, mapping out all the potential users for our context helped us to all gather more diverse, and potentially more accurate, user requirements for our design space. </p>

                    <p>We then broke off to individually research and navigate our own ways around our chosen context. I started my task by reading articles about the importance of streamline services. From this, I gained a general insight into the trend in our growing and ageing population and the heightened expectations and demands of emergency services from a changing social and environmental behaviour. I saw that this essentially was the driving force behind the potential design space for our project. So as a result, my objective for my research report became ‘To improve the efficiency and ability of the streamline of paramedic services in extending help to patients, and hence overall increase survival rates’.  </p>

                    <p>I then picked 3 precedent designs to study (Defibrillator Drone, Paramedics Rescue Pac, CPR Vest) which helped me identify a common theme to them to help me develop a stronger foundation for my concepts, and to also identify any existing issues. These insights were:


                      <ul>
                        <li>The main theme relies heavily on trying to cut back time to increase survival rates. This shows a potential area of needed improvement and of importance in this industry.
                        <li>I observed that there was a gap for holistic approaches in the paramedic industry.

                      <p> Upon seeing the defibrillator drone and the CPR vest in particular, I started to be very very excited to come up with my own ideas to answer this design space.
                        Now that I gained more ideas and understanding into my team’s chosen context, it was time for some user research to further flesh out existing issues/needs within the paramedic services. These were delivered through my chosen primary research methods of interviews, questionnaires and observations. The users included working and student paramedics, past patients who have travelled in ambulances, a pilot/drone tester, and medical students.
                        I had so much fun conducting video interviews with paramedics from Queensland. I had managed to get a hold of this lovely clinical director and active front line paramedic, Daniel, who was a great help to me during this stage. We had various phone calls discussing about his insights into technological changes in his industry, which he expressed he was very interested in. This is when he gave me the example of an European university student who had come up with the defibrillator drone idea. From talking to him, we bonded quite a bit and this is where I was able to gain valuable insights from his behind the scene stories. He shared his most interesting stories, which included a patient that was wrongly released out of a mental institution, and what he had to deal with upon being confronted with this scenario. I honestly loved talking to him and some of the other paramedics too. I gained an enormous amount of respect for them all, and I can now say that I almost religiously watch 000 emergency call reality TV shows at home when I’m free.

Overall, I was able to more clearly identify my team’s potential design avenue. However, I did find it hard at this point to picture how we could help the paramedics in an efficient and intuitive way, without interfering in their natural process. From the interviews I conducted with the paramedics, we delved into a lot of discussions about potential ideas/avenues from the identified issues in the industry. The paramedics shared a lot of insights into why it may not be able to work, or that they already had this particular system in place that works well. And from expanding on their point of views, I found it quite hard to hone my thinking into certain design concepts.

                    <p> After having completed the previous task individually, we came back together with a stronger mental map and idea of our problem area. I remember thinking at this point how interesting and beneficial it was for all of us to have completed the first task individually, and then to come back together to share our different journeys and findings from the same chosen context. I had originally thought that we would come back with roughly the same idea, but it was quite interesting to see that not only did we all have completely different insights, but our different approaches to the context had led us to all essentially have highlighted 2 more refined problem areas from our general problem context. This helped to guide us a lot in designing and ideating solutions that were more specific to our intended target users: front-line paramedics and/or patients and bystanders. These 2 areas were:
                      <ul>
                        <li>Improving technology for dangerous and hard to reach situations</li>

                    <p> Our group then decided to synthesise all our different findings into 3 main requirements, which would act as the foundation of our ideation stage. These requirements were:

                      <ul>
                        <li>The need for the design to address the expanding diversity of arising situations, particularly hard to reach situations</li>
                        <li>The requirement for the design to avoid removing total human interaction between paramedics and patients</li>
                        <li>The ability for the design to add to a more efficient routine and intervention from paramedics, through easy to use and understand designs</li>
                      </ul>
                    <p>
                      I loved that we all synthesised our findings and/or key insights into 3 main dot points, because for me, it really helped me to think more clearly whilst not straying away from the important requirements that need to be kept in mind. This was then able to allow me to think more outside the box, and I found myself starting to throw more ideas and concepts out to my group, as well as further expanding upon their ideas, in an effective way.

This was able to unite our group together regarding our problem space, through being able to prompt collective deepening of our understanding of potential concepts and issues, which enhanced the quality of our ideas. Using our general brainstorm, which effectively showed us what kind of direction our team seemed to be heading to, we then decided to come up with a more specific problem statement to better guide our ideation stage. Our specific problem statement became: </p>

                    <p>After this initial brainstorming of specific concepts, which helped us to identify the general main recurring theme, we decided to visually lay out the refined ideas from this session. These would become the reflections/basis of our stronger concepts and potential final design solutions. In going through this stage, my team and I were able to learn more about what wouldn’t work in the paramedic realm. At times, I did find myself straying a bit off topic and forgetting about the core component of including autonomy into our design solutions. This led me to spend some time developing concepts that ended up not being autonomous enough to comply with the design brief. However, looking back, I’m glad I went through this stage, as it forced me to approach the design problem space from a wider angle range. This essentially helped to trigger some really refined and high potential ideas, and allowed me to see the problem space in a different light.

                    <p>In consulting these 3 concepts with our studio tutor, Ashlyn, we quickly realised that the Autonomous Capsule Stretcher was lacking in its concept of meeting the patient’s needs. The autonomous part of this design concept would rely on patients/bystanders to be fully prepared to understand how to use the stretcher themselves, and it places full responsibility on patients/bystanders. Although this does take the burden off paramedics, and would act to be more efficient in getting to the patient and offering them quick help, it fails to incorporate the key insight my team came across in our user research: the comfort of having the human interaction from a paramedic-patient relationship. We tried to get this concept to work, due to personal attachments to this overall concept, by quickly creating hand-drawn sketches of a potential screen for this solution.

              <p> Our two concepts began to evolve further during this process, which better incorporated all of our current up to date findings and insights. At first, for our Zone MediKit Drone, the function of the drone was primarily to provide the paramedics a live view of the scene before they
                arrive. This concept was then evolved into being able to scan the patient and detect numerous injuries and issues that they are facing (giving a holistic diagnosis), before sending all of that information back to the paramedics.

              <p>During the development of the paper prototypes for the two concepts, I found myself starting to get a bit confused with both of them. They were quite similar, and I often caught myself not being able to distinguish between the 2 of them. However, with the help from my teammates and further discussions to reaffirm to everyone of the updates, our team finally produced final low-fidelity wireframes for our first round of user testing. We finally had a physical tangible reflection of our concepts!! Yay!! And we had fun building it up together, and assigning roles to everyone, which made us work like a production line. This allowed us to work effectively and have fun at the same time.

              <p>In making the low-fidelity wireframes, we quickly began to notice how complicated our designed interfaces began to be. But despite this bump in the road, we tried our best to work around this. The general consultations with my team and our tutor allowed me personally to learn about how to visually display certain features and information in a way that demands the right attention from users when needed. This was quite insightful for me, and allowed me to contribute more valuable suggestions to improve our final paper prototype look and meet the user requirements better.

              <p>The next step was to conduct user testing, which we completed through 3 testing methods:
                <ul>
                <li>Think aloud protocol</li>
                <li>Co-discovery</li>

              <p>The main issue with this stage was that our team were unfortunately unable to get into contact with the primary users for both concepts: paramedics. We used the medium of emails, phone calls, website enquiries and facebook messages to try to reach out to them. Sadly, we soon found out a bit later that due to their long processing time, and delayed responses, we were unable to conduct effective usability testing in time for our second task. All our previous paramedic contacts from our user research section unfortunately were all placed in Queensland, which made it hard to user test in person using our paper prototypes. This became a huge hindrance to my team, and we soon became stuck on where to move forward from this point. We were actually quite disappointed that we weren’t able to grab a hold of any paramedics. But, with a bit of last minute regrouping, and support from our wonderful tutor, Ashlyn, we decided to try to get some medical students to user test our concepts. Although they would not have first hand experience with our target users, they would understand similar medical terms and the rush of a medical emergency.

            <p>The more we elaborated on our 2 chosen concepts, the more I kept thinking back to the Dr. Drone concept that was a part of our refined brainstorm session. This was due to the constant reminder of one of the key insights that I gained from the user research stage of our design process (where the clear need for a more holistic approach was identified). With the struggle from not being able to test our designs on our primary users for the 2 final concepts, I was starting to waver a bit on how much I liked our team’s final 2 concepts in terms of their reflection of the design requirements of this project. This was addressed in the next group meeting, where we elaborated on potentially trying to pivot our 2 concepts to fit a patient’s use rather than a paramedic’s use. However, we decided to leave our 2 concepts as they were at this point, and to further discuss this problem when we would see our tutor next. We prayed a lot during this stage and had our fingers all crossed that it would work itself out in our favour! (Although let’s be honest, we were all just really desperate at this point!).

            <p>After advice and feedback from the next studio session, our team quickly realised the need to create a 3rd concept - a realised requirement of the evaluation report. With the realisation that our usability testing was also compromised for our original final 2 concepts, our team discussed 2 possible directions we could take next to address this issue. We could either:

              <ul>
              <li>Rapidly ideate, create and prototype 3 new concepts that addressed our problem statement through a patient/bystander’s point of view or,</li>
              <li>Put in a disclaimer admitting that our usability testing would be inaccurate, and then try to pivot a third concept to address a patient/bystander’s usability.</li>
              </ul>

          <div class="col-md-12">
            <p>My team actually originally made a decision to go with the first direction. But after 20 minutes of brainstorming and a fast attempt at hand-drawn screen sketches, Ashlyn quickly looked over them and addressed her concerns regarding the limited timespan we had to develop them again. My team and I struggled a lot during this section, and a lot of stress and panic followed as a result. However, after a night of sleep, and an additional re-grouping session, we collectively decided to try our second direction of having a disclaimer.

            <p>This was the pivotal point that led us to choose and ideate further on one of our other top concepts from our previous brainstorming of concepts stage. The third chosen concept became formulated around our ‘Dr. Drone’ concept. With the identified future usability testing issue of not being able to get paramedics, we decided to iterate on this idea through a potential patient/bystander perspective. This would additionally address our other key insights gained from our original user research phase, where one of our team members directed their user research towards the perspective of past patients that had been in an ambulance/had to call an ambulance to come to them. We felt a bit more relieved as well with this third concept, as it allowed us to have one concept to properly test usability.

            <p>In making the low fidelity paper prototype, we also used the who, what, when, where, why and how method here to use it as a means of anchoring us all to the main goal and design direction of the Dr. Drone App. During this, it also became apparent how much easier it was on the eye to visually design the display space in a way that wasn’t too noisy compared to the other 2. The other 2 concepts relied heavily on designing a space that supported the huge amount of critical information required, as well as needing a way to not overwhelm the user. My team seemed to have a lot more fun creating the low fidelity prototype for this concept, and it soon became ready for user testing! Yay!! I also personally loved that this concept was designed to be a phone app, which made it so much more fun to test it out, because we could actually simulate a realistic situation of holding and interacting with a phone screen (who doesn’t love a good phone app!).

            <p>Overall, through user testing and synthesising insights gained from them using affinity diagrams and heuristic evaluations, we were able to gain a deeper and broader understanding of each of our 3 chosen design concepts. This process of having to test our services on other people also helped me to realise some of our team’s poorly designed decisions - as in the stage of conducting the user testings for all 3 concepts, I caught myself not actually knowing how to explain certain steps/navigations to the users when they needed it. This was particularly evident for the first 2 concepts, where the lack of structural guidance and intuitive interactions led to an overall confusing user experience.

              Overall, the user testing for our three concepts saw my team and I gain a better understanding of our design space and how the effectiveness of the ability of our designs to help our users. The experience from this was very insightful and interesting, and it confronted us with the errors of some of our way of thinking and approaching our problem space. Although it was confronting and some of it made us stressed as a team (emphasise on the word stressed), it was able to allow us to break away from our tunnel vision approach. The biggest confrontation was in the realisation that our concept 1 and 2 (both designed for a paramedic to use) was going to be very complicated, particularly with the absence of paramedics to test out the usability and hence also usefulness of our concepts. However, this challenge only fuelled us up more and soon, our focus and determination were all directed into making concept 3 stronger. We were excited that with this concept, we could actually test on the right users and hence gain more valuable and specifically insightful feedbacks from them.

            <p>This section will explain why my team went for concept 3 (Dr. Drone app) as our final decision, which will then lead into the process of us creating the medium fidelity of this concept for further user testing! For me, this stage was a huge relief. Our team was reaching the end of our ropes and really struggling to make a comeback after we discovered that our marks would be cut by not testing with primary users. Before this point we had tried for well over a month to try and get any paramedic we could, and now to finally have a decision that felt right and for us to go with was a huge motivator, not only for me to try harder to catch up, but the whole team.

            <p>One of the key considerations when choosing concept 3 was through our overall heuristic results. This clearly showed to us that in terms of usability (based on design concepts and principles), our Dr Drone app concept was the strongest. Adding on to this, the overall clear strength of our proposed  Dr. Drone App (accumulated from synthesis of insights from user testing) can be outlined below:
              <ul>
              <li>The perspective of the third concept is on the patients point of view, which leveraged more ways and showed more potentials in which we could lighten the load and stress that paramedics are already facing.</li>
              <li>The concept was unique in that it aimed to make individuals more proactive about their health and to potentially double check their need for an ambulance before commiting to the service. This is able to attempt to lighten the demands of 000 calls, and hence overall contributed to strengthening this concept’s potentials</li>
              <li>This idea was also chosen based on overall positive feedback from users and our ability to test it more accurately than the other two concepts.</li>
              <li>This is explored further with the decision matrix in the next slide, showing that the Dr. Drone concept scored the highest score.</li>

            <p>On top of all the above considerations that made concept 3 a winning one in our eyes, my team and I felt more excited about taking this concept and further developing it to the final stage. As a result, we felt more of a connection to our third concept, and the fact that it also perfectly addressed our problem statement was a winning point for our team. We were now recovering from our sheer panic stage and were feeling amped up and ready to rapidly prototype a medium fidelity version of the Dr. Drone app for a final round of user testing for this stage of the design process.

However I noticed that our concept 3 ticked all the points, which was a fun moment to share with the team and a nice indication that we were finally on track and in a productive state, which I am grateful for. This checklist included:
              <ul>

            <p>We were a bit less all over the place at this point, knowing that we had concept 3 to motivate us to the end. But with the recommendation from our tutor to work hard on the report side of our project, due to the limitations in marks that we will receive due to our inabilities to test two of our concepts on primary users, my team and I were starting to feel a lot of stress. We got together a lot and worked on our documentation of our process and results through a whole full day into the late nights. Although this made us all go a little bit insane at times, it did make us stronger as a team as we had to rely on each other. And in the end, our hard efforts paid off as it forced us to better understand the industry area we were working on, and the human experience aspect of our design stage.

            <p>The user testing for the medium fidelity went extremely smoothly in the end, which was a nice relief. With user testing for the medium fidelity of Dr. Drone, we decided to add in bodystorming as a way to explore more insights from our users. I personally saw this as a really effective test to see if design was able to reach its objective of solving the set design problem. We had a lot of fun getting our friends and family to bodystorm our scenarios out in order to effectively test out our medium fidelity. I really enjoyed this stage, and I felt that the fun side of this user testing really brought out a wider range of perspectives from both the users that were testing our design, and my team. Overall it enabled us an excellent head-start for the high fidelity, which was a complete change of pace for us, and helped us very smoothly transition into making the next set of iterations in the following assessment.

Now, at this point, looking back, I can see that we may have ended up straying away from our problem statement if we were to continue our first two original concepts that required the paramedics to be our primary user testers. Particularly as we did indeed come across several big and small issues from user testing concepts 1 and 2. So i’m even more grateful and glad that our team faced the challenges that we did, and adapted to it as best as we could. In doing so, I was able to gain a very eye-opening valuable insight into the huge potential space in our problem context of directly empowering patients/bystanders. I personally love it when I take a life problem and realise the other side of the story, which I tend to believe always has a real empowering effect for effective change. I also realised that by placing a sense of control on patients/bystanders, this act in itself would decrease the overall huge burden that paramedics will always have in this critical industry.

            <p> Our team then buckled down and worked out the general theme of the high fidelity mockup. Once we talked it over with each other, and an android-look approach was taken, our team took this information (as well as the feedback from our medium fidelity) and began to build up the first high fidelity look. NOTE: This was actually extremely enjoyable to make (along with the next two versions), as we finally had a very confident vision of what we were trying to make and how it should feel for the consumer. It was a relief in comparison to the last assessment.

            <p> The Android Version or Version 1 of the high fidelity was met really well. Upon testing the interface look on people, there were some general concerns over the simplicity of the theme. Also, it did have some set back as most of our users were iOS users. It also didn’t feel like a high fidelity app (due to colour scheme, but also the lack of pages to help the flow). This feedback was reinforced by Ashlyn as well, but we still wanted to test it after that to ensure we were at least on the right track of functionality. This is when, after consultation, we pivoted to an  iOS layout and design structure! The feedback we got from our first iteration proved to be very critical in the pivot and development of version 2.

            <p> Version 2, the new iOS version. Personally I loved this version, and overall thought my team were doing well. We were extremely happy with the new look. It provided better flow and overall improved aesthetics that pushed it into the high fidelity category (unlike version 1). The new version was met extremely well during our co-discovery testing. The users had many compliments, but also did discover some bugs in the user flow (lack of buttons and some screens). 3 of the users had issues with the amount of text for the situation at hand; “who would read that much text when they are hurt?” and “make the emergency call confirmation a simple “are you sure?” rather than being long winded”. We had the addition of a new button that looked like an asterisk which was meant to act as a back button that saves the previous page you were on. Most people told us to cut it or they didn’t understand so it quietly disappeared never to be seen again for version 3.

            <p> Our final and best version, number 3 is now created. We poured everything we have learned up until this point to do the final, refining and aesthetic alterations before the presenting of our solution. We at this point are extremely proud and happy to be finished. Each of us really pulled our weight to make all this happen. It was a nice ending from a set of two assessments that went from extremely stressful to extremely satisfying as we patted each other on back and cheered complete.

            <p> Overall from this process, I believe I have become a much better designer. As this is actually my first studio in this degree, I felt a lot of the stress and overall found it a much bigger challenge than any class I had had before (but it was very rewarding!). In this assessment, particularly by ending with the creation of the high fidelity, I finally felt comfortable with everything I had learnt in design so far. I feel I have much more to learn, but the sense of accomplishment is great.  I’d like to thank Ashlyn for being a huge support to my team and I. So thanks to her for uplifting us when we needed it, and sharing her wisdom to us, as well as sharing our moment of stress (thanks for pitying us during this time haha!). That is the conclusion to my process journal and my perspective of the creation of Dr. Drone.
